# Patch applications
### ISM-1876

**Requirement**: Patches, updates or other vendor mitigations for vulnerabilities in online services are applied within 48 hours of release when vulnerabilities are assessed as critical by vendors or when working exploits exist.

### Title
**How to test:**  
Can't test in log analytics workspace 
but, if using Azure Update Manager, could use azure resource graph.
Would see if you can pull the configuration.
if classification == critical and check schedule >48hrs, then == compliant 
else non-compliant
